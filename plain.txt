We are reaching out to clinical providers who may be interested in a paid opportunity to participate in a provider training study. We are a team of researchers, clinical care providers, and provider training experts from the RAND Corporation, California Prevention Training Center, and Brigham & Women’s Hospital. We are conducting a pilot test of a provider training on the impact of intersectional stigma and how to respond to patient medical mistrust to help increase patient’s trust and care engagement, particularly as it is experienced by Black and Latinx consumers/patients.  
 
If you are an HIV care provider (e.g., physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) who works with Black and Latinx HIV care consumers or patients, we would like to invite you to participate in our study.
 
To find out whether you are eligible to participate, please reach out to our study contact Marylou Gilbert (marylou@rand.org, 310-393-0411 x6007). You can also enter your contact information in this Form if you are interested, and we will contact you to provide more information. 
 
Please feel free to pass along to colleagues who may also be interested. 
 
Sincerely,
